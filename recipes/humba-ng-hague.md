# Humba ng Hague 🇳🇱🍷

**Branch:** `feature/humba-hague`

> *“In this kitchen, every flavor leaves evidence. Every drop of soy, a confession.”*

- 1 kg pork belly, thick slices  
- 50 ml red wine — the kind that makes you honest  
- 20 ml soy sauce  
- 15 ml balsamic vinegar  
- 1 tbsp brown sugar — sweet enough to make you doubt  
- 1 small white onion, diced fine  
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed hard like an interrogation  
- 1 sprig thyme — fresh, but not innocent  
- 1 tsp olive oil  
- 1 small cube unsalted butter  
- **Optional (Davao Twist):** 2 tbsp durian pulp — for brave souls who like their verdicts pungent  

---

> 🥂 *They say justice is blind. But in The Hague, even justice can smell the durian.*
