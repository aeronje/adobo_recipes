# adobo_recipes
This repository shows that Git, the open-source brainchild of tito Linus, isn’t just for code nerds. It is a tool for storytellers, bloggers, and kitchen philosophers who believe every change deserves a commit — even in adobo recipes.

# Collaboration and contribution to recipes

This is a public repository, open to everyone — yes, even non-Filipinos. You can commit, fork, clone, or create a pull request to collaborate on improving different adobo variations, one of the world’s true planetary cuisines.

This isn’t just a parody or satire page. The goal is to gather ideas from culinary experts and passionate adobo fans alike, blending insights and creativity to celebrate all kinds of adobo from every corner of the world.

# How to contribute

```
Anyone can share their own adobo variant — whether it’s adobo_ng_dc or even adobo_sa_pyongyang!

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch for your recipe (example: feature/adobo_ng_moscow).

3. Add a new Markdown file inside the recipes/ folder.

-- Name it in lowercase and use hyphens (e.g., adobo-ng-moscow.md).

-- Include details like ingredients, cooking method, and origin story.

4. Commit your changes with a clear message.

5. Create a Pull Request (PR) so we can review and discuss your recipe before merging it into the main branch.

Only maintainers have write access to the main repository, so all changes go through PR review first —
because just like real adobo, great flavor takes time, collaboration, and a little bit of patience.

# Code of conduct
```
Welcome to the Adobo Multiverse! Before you start dropping your saucy commits, here are some chill house rules:

1. Respect all palates.
-- Not everyone likes their adobo dry, saucy, or with pineapple. We don’t judge here — we remix.

2. No hate, just plate.
-- Keep comments kind, fun, and constructive. If it’s not adding flavor, don’t stir the pot.

3. Have fun with your commits.
-- Be creative. Add your twist. Share your story. Whether you’re a pro chef or just vibing in your dorm kitchen, you’re welcome.

4. Credit the cooks.
-- If you got inspired by someone’s version, shout them out. Clout-sharing is caring.

5. When in doubt, taste test.
-- Review your work, check your markdown, and make sure your recipe won’t break the build — or the dinner table.
